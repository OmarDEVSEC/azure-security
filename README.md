End-to-end Azure security modules: Deployed via Terraform, Defender for Cloud, KQL detection, and remediated through infrastructure as code.


# Monitoring Module

## Monitoring Module

The monitoring module provides subscription-wide cost and service health oversight, deployed independently from the lab infrastructure so it survives `terraform destroy` cycles on the resources being tested.

**What it deploys:**
- **Action Group** (`ag-security-lab-alerts`) — a shared notification channel that routes alerts to email. Referenced by both the budget and service health alerts below, so any future alert can reuse it rather than duplicating notification config.
- **Consumption Budget** — a subscription-level budget with alert thresholds at 80% and 100% of a configurable monthly amount, notifying via the action group before spend gets out of hand.
- **Service Health Alert** (`service-health-alerts`) — watches for Azure platform incidents and planned maintenance events affecting the subscription, separate from monitoring the lab's own resources.

**Design decisions:**
- Deployed into its own resource group (`rg-monitoring`), isolated from the lab's resource group (`rg-azure-security`) — this means the lab environment can be torn down and rebuilt between sessions without losing budget/health alerting
- Scoped to the entire subscription rather than a single resource group, so it catches spend and health issues regardless of what gets built next in this project
